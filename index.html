        <p>My name is Jonathan but you can call me Jon. I am 21 years old, Vietnamese,  and I lived in Kent WA all my life.  When I have free time I like to stay active. I gym about 5-6 times a week and on Mon-Wed I like to attend my Brazilian Jiu-jitsu class. For my fitness goals, I am doing a program for <strong>POWER BUILDING.</strong> Power building is just building strength as well as aesthetics. For Jiu Jitsu, I hope to compete in my first tournament in the spring. Some other hobbies I have been trying to pick up are reading, guitar, and cooking. The only thing I know how to cook is chicken breast.... in the air fryer. In a couple of months, I hope to expand my recipe book.   </p>
